Admin Services API provides all the functionality to build your Internet of Things solutions using Csip.io entities. Each Csip.io entity corresponds to a resource instance within the Admin Services API context.

All Admin Services API endpoints start with https://api.csip.io/v3 base URL. Every call against the base URL with your account's api keys (i.e. user keys) are executed within the scope of your master account.
